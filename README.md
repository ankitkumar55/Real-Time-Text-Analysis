# Real-Time Text Analysis and String Replacement

This is a React-based application that allows users to analyze text in real-time. Users can type text into a textarea and get real-time statistics, including the number of unique words and the number of characters excluding spaces and punctuation. Additionally, users can search for and replace specific strings dynamically, with the replaced words being highlighted in the display.

## Features

- **Real-time text statistics:**
  - Count of unique words (case-insensitive).
  - Count of characters excluding spaces and punctuation.
  
- **String Replacement:**
  - Search for a specific word or phrase.
  - Replace all occurrences of the word with another string.
  - Replaced words are highlighted in the display area.

- **Bonus Feature:**
  - Highlight replaced words with a customizable background and underline.
